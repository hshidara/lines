# Visualizing Movie Dialogues

<img src="./img/example.png"/>

Part of my work involves timeline-based visualizations of text
utterances.
Movie subtitle files are a convenient sample: they provide the dialogues
along with the timestamps.
I've explored a few ways to visualize these dialogues based on data from
subtitle files. 
Note that this only works with SRT files for the time being.


**Try it out**

You can try out the visualizations [here](http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~rchandr/subtitles/subtitles.html).


**Dependencies**

For the javascript bits to work, I use [jQuery](http://jquery.com/),
[D3](http://d3js.org/), and the [Fisheye D3 Plugin](https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/tree/master/fisheye).
